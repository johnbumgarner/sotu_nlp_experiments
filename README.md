# Overview

<p align="justify">
This repository contains Python code used for various text analysis experiments. The corpuses used for these experiments were the State of the Union Addresses for the Presidential periods below: 
  
- Donald Trump - 2017 to 2019
- Barack Obama - 2010 to 2016
- George W. Bush - 2002 to 2008
</p>

### Experiment 1:

<p align="justify">
This experiment used the Python modules matplotlib and pandas.  The objective of this experiment was to calculate the number of times the audience either clapped or laughed during a particular State of the Union Address. The corpuses used contained meta data, which indicates what parts of the speech gathered applause or laugher.  The metrics generated are only as reliable as the data being processed. The applause and laugher keywords were manually added to the speech text by an unknown entity.  This experiment did not validate these keywords, which could have been accomplished by watching the 17 State of Union Addresses.  Additionally, these metrics cannot determine if the audience applauded for 10 seconds or 60 seconds.

The applause metrics were generated from the unverified corpuses obtained from the multiple websites, including the White House. These applause metrics indicate that President Trump's State of the Union Addresses for 2019 and 2018 received the highest levels of applause over a 17 year period. The average applause number per speech for the same 17 year period was 55.
